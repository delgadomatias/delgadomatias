# Hey there! <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/74038190/216120981-b9507c36-0e04-4469-8e27-c99271b45ba5.png" alt="Hands shake" style="height: 30px; width:30px;"/>
I'm Matias from Argentina, a Systems Engineering Student and self-taught software developer.<br />
I have solid knowledge in **React** with **Typescript**. Striving to create reusable code that won't bite me down the road.<br />
Lately, I've been working in Full Stack projects with **Next.JS**, also I've dedicated time to developing web pages with **Astro**.<br />
Right now, I'm going deeper about NodeJS and geeking out over things like Design Patterns and Software Architecture 🤔.<br /><br />
_I like to define myself as a problem solver. I also enjoy learning new tools that allow me to face any challenge 🛤️._
